Using the temps.txt data file (DownloadLinks to an external site.) which has temperatures in degrees Celsius create a new data file (table.txt) that consists of a table of temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. The equation to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

F = 9.0/5.0 * Celsius + 32.0

To convert Celsius to Kelvin add 273.15 degrees.

The table should have headings for each temperature as shown below. Upload the text file to Canvas.
